# Supplier-Order-System

Overview
A system where clients can browse and order products via an intermediary portal client. 

The system must allow customers to search, browse and select products.

Selected products are saved to an order, and the remaining count of products needs to be reflected on the user interface. 

Administrators of the system must have additional access and be able to add, edit and delete products from the inventory.
